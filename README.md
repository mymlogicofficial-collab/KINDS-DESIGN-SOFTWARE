K.I.D.S.-Intellectual Development Software. K.I.D.S. - for CREATIVE kids. A fully customizable app that adapts and grows WITH your child. Thanks to  AbbSistance™, there's NO MORE "bad guy" MOMENTS.. You don't set the limitations, __they__ do. 
Every question they answer, or can't, begins setting up safe guards and customizing how the app will be displayed. 
Safety Feature # 1; NO Direct ACCESS to the internet! EVER! Tourguide, Pal, and Safety officer, Abb (or Abb"y") never changes your phones safety settings, Abb doesn't have to. Abb just makes sure the options that may compromise you are never there to begin with. 

If the child/youth/AWAF (Adult w/ Alternate Focus*), using the app can't answer, is unsure, or holding up fingers to answer a question, Abb is going to set K.I.D.S. into WE-Mode (WE-Mode is a function of AbbSistence™.) Abb doesn't go into an automated state, rather, an assist state that allows Abb the ability to continue to set safeguards without concrete answers (if the interactor is constantly unable to answer the questions, this tells Abb that lots of help and guidance will likely be required beyond setup. Limitations will be enabled and reviewed as interactions progresses)
This help includes picture prompts, read assist, spelling assist, and read and ask. Abb also offers AbbVice™ for creative guidance and Abbcademics™ for help with studies.

Older kids will have access to more advanced features. 
No, they can't lie their way to more options. 
Abb has incognito security questions asked along the way, as well as, anytime a request for advanced options is made. My recall must be ALL RE- and no CALL. [name] How old are we again? [answer] "Ah, right, [age, if correct, and I am still rounding the corner of 100. Abb initiats a low-key validator, generally where the __yes__ answer is NOT the proper answer. 
Repeat attempts trigger coloring book mode. 

There are parental override functions. If you feel your kid is ready for more than Abb allows, you can adjust the AbbVailable™ options. Although some may find this to be inconvenient, you can't access AbbVailable™ override functions in the app. It must be done online. However, you can set up the add-on app feature AbbVailable™ Options on your phone or other device. This is also where YOU authorize access to download, print, share options.
