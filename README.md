K.I.D.S.-Intellectual Development Studio. K.I.D.S. - for CREATIVE kids. A fully customizable app that adapts and grows WITH you. You are NO LONGER the "bad guy". You don't set the limitations, __they__ do. 
Every question they answer, or can't, begins setting up safe guards and customizing how the app will be displayed. 
Security guard NUMBER 1. NO direct accesss to the internet. This app isnt modifying YOUR safety and security presets on YOUR phone. It doesn't have to. It just makes sure the options that may compromise you are never there to begin with. 

If the person using the app cant answer, is unsure, or holding up fingers to answer a question, Abb is going to set K.I.D.S. into WE-mode, A setting thats has Abb doing most of the choosing by helping your kid get to where they want to go. 
This help includes picture prompts, read assist, spelling assist, and read and ask. 

Older kids will have access to more advanced features. 
No, they can't lie their way to more options. 
Abb has incognito security questions asked along the way, as well as, anytime a request for advanced options is made. What age are you again? My recall must be stuck on re-. Kid answers. Abb initiats a low-key validator, generally where the __yes__ answer is NOT the proper answer. 
Repeat attempts trigger coloring book mode. 

There are parental override functions. If you feel your kid is ready for more than Abb allows, you can adjust the Abbvailable™ options. 

If it seems something is constantly too advanced, after attempts to simplify the material have been made, Abb will take that function away TEMPORARILY and NOT while the child is actively attempting to get a hang on it. 

Pre stocked with activity books. Design your own activity page. Audio/video editing functions. 
Abbvice™, recomendations if someone is unsure what they'd like to create.
Abb-Reads, and Read Along functions. 
AbbCademics™- school work assist. No cheating, all learning.

Create a CUSTOMS sticker, backed AND shipped by SE CUSTOMS™. Cool. Original. Mine.™ 
There are limits to amount of stickers made and requested unless you want to subscribe to the SE STICKER FACTORY™. And Abb will NEVER ask your child that question. 
It's an optional add on sunscription thats 4.99/mo. 
(alternatively, if you have your own printer/sticker printer, all material that can be downloaded/printed are available for that function and is universal to almost all formatting**)

NO Ads, NO upgrades. Excludes free mandatory software/version upgrades. 

K.I.D.S.- for __CREATIVE kids.__ Are you a __CREATIVE__ kid?™
